## Introduction
Welcome to Open Shot Golf (formerly JaySimG)!  
  
Open Shot Golf is an open source golf simulator built using the Godot Engine. This golf sim was built to interface with the PiTrac Launch Monitor  
You can find their github page here: https://github.com/jamespilgrim/PiTrac  
### Current State
Launch Monitor Support:  
- At this point, the golf sim only **OFFICIALLY** supports connections to a PiTrac launch monitor. However it should technically support any GSPro interface with the port set to the correct value.
  
Sim Features:  
- The golf sim features a range mode with data readouts, club selection, and range session recording. There are a few more range features being planned at the momemnt but feel free to open an issue with any suggestions or areas of improvement.

Platforms:  
- Linux
- Windows
- Mac (theoretically - this is untested).
  
### Future State
Launch Monitor Support:  
- There is no current plan to support any commercial launch monitors but we welcome any ideas or contributions in this area.
  
Sim Features:
- As for full golf course play, this is the next major milestone in this project's development. Details on implementation are sparse if not non-existent. Initial planning and architecting of this feature will be starting soon. Stay tuned!

Platforms:  
- Support is planned for Android and iOS although implementation has not yet started. It is currently possible to build the project for Android but this is untested.
- Console support has been considered. If there is any demand for this we will consider implementation down the line. (This will likely be a big undertaking getting SDKs/dev consoles/accounts/etc.)
